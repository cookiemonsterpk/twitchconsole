			Welcome to Twitch Console! <br />
			<br />
			<div id="help">
				This page can be used to watch and manage many <a href="http://www.twitch.tv">twitch.tv</a> streams and chats at one time. <br />
				<br />
				Start adding streams by typing the stream name and pressing "Add Stream" in the upper left. <br />
				<br />
				You can load the page with streams already on it by including a question mark and hash followed by the names of the streams separated by commas.  For example: <a href="http://www.twitchconsole.tv/?#cosmowright,siglemic">http://www.twitchconsole.tv/?#cosmowright,siglemic</a> <br />
				<br />
				You can share your current set of streams at any time by giving someone else the URL.  The page will keep it up to date as you add and remove streams. <br />
				<br />
				Twitch Console was inspired by <a href="http://www.multitwitch.tv">MultiTwitch</a>.

<div id="about">
	Twitch Console was inspired by a very similar page called <a href="http://www.multitwitch.tv">MultiTwitch</a>.  I encourage you to take a look at that project if you like this one! <br />
	<br />
	MultiTwitch, while it is a great project and a great idea, doesn't allow you to add and remove streams and chats at-will, so I built Twitch Console to give users more control over what would appear on the page (hence, "console"). <br />
	<br />
	In addition, the page is built to be small and completely self-contained.  All of the actions are performed on-page in your own browser. <br />
	<br />
	If you would like to improve, contribute to, or fork Twitch Console, it is available on <a href="http://github.com/dbrobbins/twitchconsole">GitHub</a>.  Feel free to report issues or request features there if contributing isn't your cup of tea; I'll do my best to be responsive!

<div id="donate">
	I am touched that you're interested in donating!  Domains and hosting are not free, so I sincerely appreciate it. <br />
	<br />
	Donations will go towards costs associated with running this site.  The more I receive, the longer the site can remain available. <br />
	<br />
	There is not currently any way for you to donate to this project, but I encourage you to check again later. <br />
	<br />
	If you aren't a fan of sending your hard-earned money to strangers, I'm also considering providing a "show me ads" option which will serve a single ad on the page (opt-in only, of course).

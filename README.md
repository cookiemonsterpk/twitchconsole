Twitch Console
==============
Inspired by MultiTwitch (http://www.multitwitch.tv)

Twitch Console is a simple web page that provides an interface for adding and removing Twitch streams so that any number of arbitrary streams (of your choice) can be watched simultaneously.

The content of this project is free to use.
